# gcpadder-linux-fork

Lazy Fork that is mostly vibe coded and only changes a few things for my own convenience.<br>
I barely do stuff myself on it due to my lack of C++ knowledge so i let AI do the coding and adjust things personally in post when able to.

TL;DR: If you are against using AI code do not use this.

Most notable changes:
- reading and applying IP Address and Port from configuration.
- remapping of B, X, Y and Z for Virtual Controller mapping.
- triggers working properly
- reduction of console spam by only printing when a button gets pressed / released.
